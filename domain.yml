      I understand a handful of simple concepts related to the monarchy in the UK.
      There are various ways to select a particular ruler, such as
      the number (eg VI, 6 or sixth) or by a value (eg "William Rufus").
      Then you can pick out specific information such as:
      - Date of birth
      - End of reign
      - Famous battles
      - House (eg of Tudor)
      Then the ML magic happens, I try to understand what you've said and then look up details
      based on entities recognised in a database.
      Have a go!
      (or try "Give me an example" if you're really not sure :D)

      I am RoyBotic, a simple chatbot focused on basic questions regarding the monarchy in the UK.
      I have been programmed in Python, using a machine learning backend that recognises user
      input and passes details to a script which in turn translates them so that relevant details
      can be accessed in a database, following which answers are constructed and given back to the user.
  utter_rude:
  - text: That isn't something I can really comment on.
  - text: Perhaps I've misunderstood what you meant to say?
  - text: Is there anything useful I can help you with?
  - text: I'm not sure I understood what you just said.
  - text: Ah the rich expressive nature of the English language.
  - text: Sadly I'm just a simple bot so it means very little to me!
